      "    \"Toxicokinetics\": \"Formaldehyde is a normal endogenous metabolite and has been found in all tissues investigated. Human exhaled air contains formaldehyde in concentrations in the order of 0.001–0.01 mg/m3, with an average value of about 0.005 mg/m3.Formaldehyde reacts at the site of first contact and/or is eliminated rapidly as formic acid in the urine or as CO2 in the expired air or it enters the carbon-1 pool in the body. Dermal absorption should differentiate between penetration through the skin possibly leading to systemic effects and penetration through and into the skin possibly leading to local effects. For monkeys, penetration through the skin was 4% and through + into skin 15%. In rats and guinea pigs, higher dermal absorptions were found. In humans 76% absorption was reported after inhalation exposure for the nasal passages (90% in rats) and almost complete absorption in the total respiratory tract of humans and rats (Overton et al., 2001). Therefore 100% systemic absorption is used for respiratory tract of rats and humans. Almost complete absorption was reported after oral exposure. Formaldehyde is rapidly metabolized (t1/2 ~ 1 min) by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FAD). Since toxicity is a consequence of exposure to a very reactive parent compound that is not removed from the site of application allometric scaling is not appropriate (Guidance on information and chemical safety assessment; Chapter R.8; p. 31). FAD is highly conserved and is found in all tissues and species investigated as the most important scavenger for the highly toxic endogenous formaldehyde. In several investigations no polymorphism of FAD has been detected in humans. Therefore, no assessment factors for inter- and intraspecies variability are appropriate as long as formaldehyde is the toxic entity under consideration.\",\n",

No studies according to current guidelines are available on eye irritation; however, formaldehyde has corrosive properties (no testing required). There is evidence that sensory eye irritation in humans due to exposure to gaseous formaldehyde is the most sensitive endpoint. From clinical studies with volunteers, it is concluded that the NOAEC for subjective and objective sensory eye irritation was 0.7 ppm in case of a constant exposure level or 0.4 ppm with four 15 min peaks of 0.8 ppm.\",\n",
      "    \"Sensitisation\": \"There is sufficient evidence for sensitizing properties of formaldehyde in the guinea pig maximisation test (GPMT), in the Buehler test in guinea pigs and in the mouse local lymph node assay (LLNA).

Formaldehyde is also a dermal allergen in humans. Anaphylaxis has been documented in case reports. The threshold in sensitized humans under exaggerated occluded test conditions was estimated to be 3 µg/cm². In non-sensitzised humans a threshold of 0.037% corresponding to 37 µg/cm² has been determined for induction of skin sensitization.A weight of evidence assessment does not indicate that formaldehyde may induce or exacerbate asthma or its related lung function.\",\n",

General signs of toxicity occur secondary to these local lesions. In chronic drinking water studies in rats, local effects in the forestomach and stomach were induced, the NOAEC is 0.020-0.026% formaldehyde in drinking water. For systemic effects the NOAEL is >= 82 mg/kg bw/day in males and 109 mg/kg bw/day in females. Studies on repeated dermal dose toxicity in compliance to current Guidelines are not available. Local effects in the upper respiratory tract were induced after repeated inhalation exposure in experimental animals. The most sensitive site in rodents and monkeys is the respiratory epithelium in the anterior part of the nasal cavity. At higher dose levels also the olfactory epithelium, larynx or trachea were affected, especially in monkeys. Rats are more sensitive than mice or hamsters. The LOAEC is 2 ppm in rats (2.4 mg/m³), 3 ppm in monkeys and 6 ppm in mice. The overall NOAEC in experimental animals for local effects is 1 ppm (1.2 mg/m³). The NOAEC for systemic effects in long-term inhalation studies in rats and mice is 15 ppm. As mentioned above the most sensitive endpoint in humans is sensory eye irritation by exposure to formaldehyde gas. In a controlled study with volunteers the NOAEC was 0.7 ppm at constant exposure conditions and 0.4 ppm with peaks of 0.8 ppm.

Negative results with buccal cells were reported in a recent controlled clinical study after repeated exposure to <= 1ppm. The mechanism of clastogenicity might be related to DNA-protein cross-links and their repair. DNA-protein cross-links and DNA adducts at the site of first contact have been demonstrated after inhalation exposure in rats and monkeys.

Nevertheless, there was still a statistically significant increase for the tumor type. But the conclusion of the authors that formaldehyde is a human carcinogen for NPC has been challenged. A correlation between formaldehyde exposure and leukaemia, especially myeloid leukaemia, was seen in some studies but not all. However, this tumour type is considered biologically not plausible. Again, the evidence that formaldehyde exposure is causally associated with leukemia has been challenged by several authors.Generally, there is evidence for a threshold effect concerning tumor induction in the upper respiratory tract, based on the highly non-linear dose response relationship for tumor induction and effects related to carcinogenicity, like histopathological lesions, cell proliferation, DNA protein cross links or effects on the mucus apparatus. On this basis the substance has been classified in Cat 4 by German MAK commission as for the carcinogenic potential a non-genotoxic mode of action is of prime importance and genotoxic effects play no or at most a minor part (Greim 2000).

      "        \"Formaldehyde is a carcinogen in the upper respiratory tract as has been shown by experiments in rats and mice, while the epidemiological evidence in this respect is not convincing (RAC, 2012). It is generally agreed in the science community that this effect is driven by local cytotoxicity followed by regenerative cell replication (RCP) (McGregor at al., 2006; MAK, 2000; SCOEL; 2015). RCP has been studied in the most sensitive rat and numerous studies have consistently shown a NOAEL of 2 ppm (Gelbke et al., 2014). Interspecies extrapolations have to take into account respiratory physiology which shows major differences when comparing rats on the one side, with non-human primates and humans on the other (DeSesso, 1993). Therefore, ideally RCP caused by cytotoxic irritation should be studied in humans. As this is not possible because of ethical reasons, sensory irritation should be taken as the more sensitive surrogate as compared to cytotoxic irritation. Numerous studies are available for sensory irritation and all have shown that eye irritation is a more sensitive parameter than irritation to the nose or the throat, the potential targets for formaldehyde carcinogenicity. Therefore, using sensory eye irritation as the starting point for risk assessment has a high, albeit not quantifiable, inbuilt margin of safety because of sensory instead of cytotoxic irritation and irritation to the eye instead of the upper respiratory tract. Studies in humans may either measure subjective ratings of sensory irritation, or objective parameters like eye blinking frequency or conjunctival redness. Subjective ratings depend on many potential confounders (like anxiety, expectation, or other psychological factors) and therefore preference must be given to studies measuring objective parameters.\",\n",
      "        \"Such studies are now available (Lang et al., 2008; Mueller et al., 2013) showing no increase of objective signs of eye irritation at concentrations of 0.7 ppm over 4 h or at 0.4 ppm superimposed by 4 peaks of 0.8 ppm. For sensory irritation the is strong evidence that after exposure periods of 4 h an effect plateau has been reached (Brüning et al., 2014). This NOEL is well in line with former studies relying mainly on subjective reporting of sensory irritation. In total, a database for about 400 exposed volunteers has been published. As sensory irritation is a physiological effect (although taken here a surrogate for the adverse cytotoxic irritation) these concentrations represent a NOEL and not a NOAEL.\",\n",
      "        \"For assessment of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity has also to be taken into consideration, although this effect is not considered to be the driver of carcinogenicity. The genotoxic effects of formaldehyde are formation of DPX as known since decades and DNA-adducts in the form of the N2-hydroxymethyl-dG adduct as more recently identified. NOAELs for these effects have not been established. Apart from species differences due to respiratory physiology, also the genotoxicity by endogenous formaldehyde, being present in every cell, has to be taken into account. A differentiation between genotoxicity caused by endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde has been achieved by inhalation of [14CD2]formaldehyde. After a single 6 h exposure to 0.7 ppm only 1% of the total DNA-adduct load is caused by the exogenous formaldehyde, the rest of 99% stem from endogenous formaldehyde. A highly non-linear dose response relation was observed, for example a 21.7-fold increase in exposure leads to a 286-fold increase in exogenous adducts. But these adducts have a biological half-life of about 7 days. At steady state after prolonged exposure the exogenous adducts will be by a factor of 5.5 higher than after a single exposure, as shown by inhalation at 2 ppm over 28 days. Extrapolation to the lowest experimental dose shows that after a prolonged exposure to 0.7 ppm (the lowest dose tested in this series of experiments) endogenous adducts will exceed the exogenous by a factor of 14 to 22. And due to the highly non-linear dose response relationship this factor will even be higher at lower concentrations and endogenous adducts will be far prevail. In addition, it was shown that the ratio of exogenous/endogenous adducts in primates is by a factor of ~5 lower than in rats, because of the different respiratory physiology and higher endogenous adducts in the primates. This finding strongly supports the former observation of Casanova et al. (1991) that DPX formation in rats is much higher than in monkeys. These data demonstrate that genotoxicity in rats is more pronounced than in primates.\",\n",
      "        \"As cytotoxic irritation is the driver for carcinogenicity, the starting point for a carcinogenic risk assessment should be the NOEL of 0.7 ppm observed in controlled exposure studies with humans and the question of an appropriate assessment factor (AF) for intra-human variability has to be addressed. No guidance is given by ECHA (2012) for an AF to be applied to a NOEL for physiological sensory effects, but ECETOC (2010) proposes an AF of 1. This is supported by Brüning et al. (2014) who also proposed an AF of 1 for sensory irritation in controlled human exposure studies based on a detailed assessment of a recent database. The question remains whether the sensitivity of the volunteers in the studies of Lang et al. (2008) and Mueller et al. (2013) might have been lower than that of the target population, i.e. the workforce. Firstly, it was shown by Mueller that the NOEL was the same for subjects hypo- and hypersensitive for nasal irritation to CO2. In addition, the age of the subjects studied was <~40 years and is therefore at the lower end of that of the general workforce. It is known (Doty et al., 2004) that sensory irritation decreases with age. And finally, all volunteers were non-smokers (what will not be the case for the workforce) and smokers are less sensitive to nasal irritation (Doty et al., 2004). As both of these studies fulfill the quality criteria given by Brüning et al. (2014) an AF of 1 for the NOEL is appropriate. This AF of 1 would lead to a DNEL of 0.4 ppm with superimposed peaks of 0.8 ppm reflecting the variable workplace exposure situations.\",\n",
      "        \"Finally the NOAELs observed in rats have to be discussed in relation to derivation of the DNEL. As the inhalation route is under consideration for rats and humans, the AF of 4 for correction of differences in metabolic rate is not to be applied. This leaves according to ECHA (2012) default AFs of 2.5 for toxicokinetic intra-species differences not related to metabolic rate (small part) and toxicodynamic differences (larger part) and for intra-human variability of 5 for workers. Both of these default AFs can be reduced considerably for 3 reasons: 1. The toxic action of formaldehyde depends on the molecule itself by simple adduction to DNA and proteins which is basically identical in all species and therefore without inter-species variability. 2. Detoxification is governed by ADH5, an enzyme highly efficient and conserved in all species. Especially for humans, it has been shown that polymorphism is not likely to play a role for detoxification of exogenous or endogenous formaldehyde (apart from Fanconi Anemia patients) provided that the endogenous pool is not depleted. This will not be the case at exposure concentrations <2 ppm (Andersen et al., 2010; Casanova et al. 1989). 3. For high quality sensory irritation studies or when based on a broad database, an AF of 1 is appropriate to address intraspecies variability for sensory irritation (Brüning et al., 2014).For such a situation with good evidence that the default AFs are over-conservative, no guidance is given by ECHA (2012). But it is admitted by ECHA that the database they considered is very scarce. This limitation is overcome by the systematic analysis of Brüning et al. (2014) proposing a total factor of 3 for extrapolating animal data to humans.\",\n",
      "        \"This AF of 3 should then be applied to the NOAEL for RCP. An analysis of all related publications has consistently shown a NOAEL of 2 ppm (Gelbke et al., 2014). This would lead to a DNEL of 0.7 ppm.\"\n",
      "    ],\n",
      "    \"For histopathological lesions a NOAEL of 1 ppm was found for rats and monkeys. Monkeys were continuously exposed over 26 weeks (22 h/d, 7 d/week) (Rusch et al., 1983) without any exposure free time for repair of lesions in contrast to exposures at the workplace. Therefore, workplace exposure conditions would most probably lead to a higher NOAEL in monkeys. For the NOAEL of 1 ppm in rats it has to be taken into consideration that the lesions observed at the LOAEL (2 ppm) cannot be regarded as prestages to tumor development, neither by their histopathological features nor by their location (Gelbke et al., 2014). Applying the AF of 3 to the histopathological NOAEL would lead to a DNEL of 0.3 ppm. In summary, by application of the AFs proposed here, the following DNELs can be derived\": [\n",
      "        \"- Sensory irritation in humans: 0.4 ppm (AF of 1)\",\n",
      "        \"- RCP in rats: 0.7 ppm (AF of 3)\",\n",

It is produced endogenously from serine, glycine, methionine and choline, and it is generated in the demethylation of N-, O- and S-methyl compounds. It is an essential intermediate in the biosynthesis of purines, thymidine and certain amino acids. Owing to its high reactivity at the site of contact and rapid metabolism, exposure of humans, monkeys or rats to formaldehyde by inhalation does not alter the concentration of formaldehyde in the blood from that endogenously present, which is about 2–3 mg/l for each of the three species. This concentration represents the total concentration of both free and reversibly bound endogenous formaldehyde in the blood. The absence of an increase after inhalation is explained by the fact that formaldehyde reacts rapidly at the site of contact. As a consequence of the endogenous formation, human exhaled air contains formaldehyde in concentrations in the order of 0.001–0.01 mg/m3, with an average value of about 0.005 mg/m3.\",\n",

In the view of RAC, RAC considers that the absence of a sensory irritation effect at formaldehyde concentrations below 1.24 mg/m³ (1 ppm) is uncertain. Due to high variability of the measured effect (large ranges, high standard deviations), the low numbers of volunteers (yielding low statistical power) and the additional uncertainties identified, false negative results at 0.62 mg/m³ (0.5 ppm) or lower cannot be excluded. The studies of Lang et al. (2008) and Mueller et al. (2013), thus, cannot be used to derive a DNEL, because the uncertainties are too high and the lack of observed effects cannot be considered as evidence for the absence of dose-related effects.

      "        \"In the same document (RAC & SEAC 2020), as part of the socio-economic assessment SEAC estimated that the EU had a housing stock of about 250 million dwellings in 2015 with an estimated 0.7 % of the EU’s housing stock, or 1.75 million, coming from newly built/completed dwellings. In addition, according to section 2.5.2 of the Background Document, the average household in the EU had 2.3 members in 2016. Based on these numbers, SEAC assumed that 4 million individuals live in newly built dwellings each year (= 1.75 million dwellings built per year with 2.3 individuals per dwelling). This means that for the RAC proposal to break even, 6 522 nasopharyngeal cancer cases would have to be avoided among these 4 million individuals. In other words, 1 631 in 1 million (= 6 522 nasopharyngeal cancer cases in 4 million individuals) would have to suffer nasopharyngeal cancer for the RAC proposal to break even. However, according to IARC (2018) data, in 2018 the incidence rate of nasopharyngeal cancer in the EU was only 7.5 in 1 million (crude rate). This means that one would need to see a more than 217 times higher incidence rate than is actually observed for the RAC proposal to break even clearly implying that the RAC evaluations and DNELs are by far overconservative.\",\n",
      "        \"Thus, RAC ended up with DNELs from rats in the range of 6 – 10 µg/m³. Interestingly, exhaled air of humans contains formaldehyde in concentrations in the order of 1 – 10 µg/m³, with an average of about 5 µg/m³, i.e. the formaldehyde concentration in human exhaled air is in the same concentration range as the RAC rat DNELs. Given the fact, that indoor concentrations of formaldehyde under typical living conditions in Europe are between 11 and 42 µg/m³ and usually below 30 µg/m³, these DNELs imply that we would all be at risk of developing effects in the respiratory system or tumors from indoor formaldehyde exposure. This is clearly not the case. This simple comparison and ‘reality check’ clearly shows that – though considering a threshold mode of action - the RAC DNELs from rats are clearly overconservative due to the formal use of assessment factors. Even the final DNEL of 50 µg/m³ from the monkey study is overconservative in that way, that the same AF of 2.5 was taken for inter- and intraspecies differences in sensitivity in rats and monkeys. However, it is evident that the sensitivity of monkeys better reflects human sensitivity than rats and therefore a lower AF in monkeys would be justified with which one would end up more or less with the WHO value.\",\n",

      "        \"In contrast, the WHO indoor guideline value was set to 100 µg/m³ in 2010 in a less formal but rather more pragmatic approach considering and evaluating over 150 publications on various endpoints. The WHO value is a 30 min time-weighted average concentration for every 30 min interval during the day lifelong. It will prevent effects on the respiratory tract as well as long term health such as nasopharyngeal cancer. The WHO indoor guideline value was reviewed again in 2013 and 2017 considering all relevant endpoints and all available publications. In neither of the reviews, there were any findings or effects, either acute (e.g. eye irritation) or long-term (e.g. cancer) in nature, published that questioned or contradicted the WHO guideline value. The recent studies included once more confirmed the non-linear dose response relationship of formaldehyde and that no health effects have been observed below this value.\",\n",

(2008) and Mueller et al.
